# Yavalath 
One of the coolest project on my studies - game Yavalath in javascipt made for the **Selected Areas of Practical Software Development** lecture.

You can check it out [here](http://mysterious-woodland-15958.herokuapp.com/ "Link to the game")

In order to play the game you have to create an account, login, enter any of the free rooms and wait for your opponent to join. After some games you can also check you statistics.

If you don't know the game itself, you can find the description [here](https://boardgamegeek.com/blogpost/2814/yavalath-evolutionary-game-design "Game description, rules and common strategies")
