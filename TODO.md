# Nice to have

* chat on the right
* highlight the last placed hex
* whose turn - square with player color
* colourful hexagons on the background on other pages
* choose the first player randomly
* both players need to agree to restart
* Bug: request is before disconnect so when entering rooms you see that you are in the room you just left
